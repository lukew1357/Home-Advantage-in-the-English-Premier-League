# Home Advantage in the English Premier League

This project explores the concept of **home advantage** within the English Premier League (EPL), using statistical analysis and data visualisation to investigate how playing at home impacts team performance.

The project was developed as part of my applied data science and statistics work, combining football knowledge with technical skills to draw meaningful insights from historical match data.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on:

✅ Examining win, draw, and loss trends for home and away teams  
✅ Quantifying the magnitude of home advantage over different seasons  
✅ Visualising patterns to highlight how home advantage varies across teams and time  
✅ Discussing potential factors contributing to the observed effects  

## Key Findings

- Historical EPL data reveals a consistent home advantage trend, with home teams typically winning more often than away teams.
- Variability exists between seasons, with some years showing stronger home advantage than others.
- The analysis considers potential influences such as crowd support, travel fatigue, and psychological factors.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** for data processing and analysis  
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualisation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive exploration  

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project includes historical results from the English Premier League. Data was sourced from publicly available football statistics websites.

## Future Work

Further improvements and extensions could include:

- Expanding the dataset to cover more leagues or competitions  
- Investigating the impact of external factors (e.g., COVID-19 restrictions on crowd attendance)  
- Applying machine learning techniques to predict match outcomes based on venue
